# Create++
_A small Create addon I made for my modpack, [Create+](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-mod-plus)._

Done:

- A cogwheel sequenced assembly recipe, with its own incomplete cogwheel item to go with it
- Other recipes made for better compat between mods
- **Inverted Gearshift and Clutch:** Work correctly, but ponder is unfinished. Right clicking a gearshift or clutch with a redstone torch turns them into their inverted versions.  
When inverted, no power means they will act like their powered, non-inverted counterparts, and when they are powered by redstone, they act like a shaft, just like their unpowered, non-inverted counterparts.

Work in progress:

- **Brass gearbox and brass chain drive:** works and has textures, but no functionality difference between andesite versions.  
- **Brass Gearbox:** should be able to block off sides with brass casing  
- **Brass Chain Drive:** should be able to connect in more than 1 direction

Planned:

- **Even More brass versions of blocks** with more functionality (suggest what block I should do next and what features it should have in the issues tab!)
-Probably will make a **brass drill** with silk touch next, but it will mine at 1/4 the speed of a normal drill.
- **Redstone clock:** _configurable_ redstone clock (like pulse extender and pulse repeater in base Create)
- **Redstone timer:** (If you have a better name, tell me!) if a redstone pulse at it's input side lasts for the configured time, send a redstone signal at the output side
- **Ponders** for new blocks

Feel Free to suggest more, or make a pull request that adds one of these features or even something you came up with!
