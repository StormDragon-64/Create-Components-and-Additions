# Create++
_A small Create addon I made for my modpack, [Create+](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-mod-plus)._

Done:

- **A cogwheel sequenced assembly recipe**, with its own incomplete cogwheel item to go with it.
- **Other mod compat recipes and some recipe changes**.
- **Inverted Gearshift and Clutch:** Right-clicking a gearshift or clutch with a redstone torch turns them into their inverted versions. (When inverted, no power means they will act like their powered, non-inverted counterparts, and when they are powered by redstone, they act like a shaft, just like their unpowered, non-inverted counterparts.)
- **Brass Gearbox:** has sides you can cover by right-clicking with brass casing in your hand. Covering sides prevents rotation for transferring to and from that side.

Work in progress:

- **Brass chain drive:** works and has textures, but no functionality difference between andesite version.  
It should be able to connect in more than 1 direction, but I have no idea how to implement that.

Planned:

- **Even More brass versions of blocks** with more functionality (suggest what block I should do next and what features it should have in the issues tab!)
- **Redstone Clock:** configurable redstone clock, you choose how often it will pulse a signal.
- **Redstone Timer:** (If you have a better name, tell me!) if a redstone pulse at it's input side lasts for the configured time, send a redstone signal at the output side.
- **Redstone Counter:** Outputs a signal if a signal comes in the same amount of times it's configured to.
- **Redstone Comparer:** Outputs signal if the input signal matches the configured amount. 
- **Ponders** for new blocks

Feel Free to suggest more, or make a pull request that adds one of these features or even something you came up with!
