# Create++
_A small Create addon I made for my modpack, [Create+](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-mod-plus)._

I have already added:

- A cogwheel sequenced assembly recipe, with its own incomplete cogwheel item to go with it
- Other recipes made for better compat between mods

I'm working on:

- Brass versions of blocks with more functionality
- I have already made a brass chain drive and a brass gearbox, but they don't have custom functionality yet  
-The current plan is to make the brass chain drive able to connect in multiple directions at the same time (eg. upwards as well as to the sides)  
-The brass gearbox will be able to be right clicked with casing to block that side from transferring power

Planned:

- An inverted gearshift and clutch (like clutch/gearshift but enabled by default and redstone disables it.)
It would be cool if this was a setting that you could toggle on normal clutch/gearshift, but I'm not sure if that's possible
- Redstone clock: _configurable_ redstone clock (like pulse extender and pulse repeater in base Create)
- Redstone timer (If you have a better name, tell me!)**:** if a redstone pulse at it's input side lasts for the configured time, send a redstone signal at the output side

Feel Free to suggest more, or make a pull request that adds one of these features or even something you came up with!
