# Create++
_A small Create addon I made for my modpack, [Create+](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-mod-plus)._

Done:

- A cogwheel sequenced assembly recipe, with its own incomplete cogwheel item to go with it
- Other recipes made for better compat between mods
- Adjustable chain gearshift

Done, but could have better functionality I don't know how to code yet: (pull request pls ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆðŸ¥º)
- **Inverted clutch and gearshift:** works as an inverted clutch and gearshift and has textures, but right now it uses a recipe to convert between inverted and not inverted.  
I want to be able to wrench and right click, shift right click with a redstone torch, or wrench and scroll (Think of how you can change between clockwise and counter-clockwise on a windmill) on the block to switch modes.

Work in progress:

- **Brass gearbox and brass chain drive:** works and has textures, but no functionality difference between andesite versions.  
  **Brass Gearbox:** should be able to block off sides with brass casing  
  **Brass Chain Drive:** should be able to connect in more than 1 direction

Planned:

- **Even More brass versions of blocks** with more functionality (suggest what block I should do next and what features it should have in the issues tab!)
-Probably will make **brass drill** with silk touch next, but it will be half speed
- **Redstone clock:** _configurable_ redstone clock (like pulse extender and pulse repeater in base Create)
- **Redstone timer:** (If you have a better name, tell me!) if a redstone pulse at it's input side lasts for the configured time, send a redstone signal at the output side
- **Ponders** for new blocks

Feel Free to suggest more, or make a pull request that adds one of these features or even something you came up with!  
Or just make a pull request to clean up my code... pls...
